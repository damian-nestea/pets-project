# Pets Project

Project where I used HTML, CSS and Javascript.
It started as a simple landing page including Header, Content and Footer, using some basic HTML and CSS concepts like positioning div's through Flexbox and styling the content of the page using the box-model, colors, fonts and so on.
This project is part of the course TheOdinProject. The design is provided on the course.
After some months I decided to add more of my HTML, CSS and JS knowledge such as animations, responsivity, mobile-first developing and added more pages to build a Single Page Application(SPA).
