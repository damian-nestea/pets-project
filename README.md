# pets-project
Project where I'll be using basic HTML and CSS knowledge including Flexbox.
I'll make a simple landing page including Header, Content and Footer, using some basic HTML and CSS concepts like positioning div's through Flexbox and styling the content of the page using the box-model, colors, fonts and so on.
This project is part of the course TheOdinProject. The design is provided on the course.
